I have learnt the following things in Git.

Git is used for version control and we can work on local host and use git server to collabrate with other users.
Free Git server is Github.

To install Git:
Go to google--> git for windows-->download and install it (git Bash will be installed and its used to work on git)

To Configure Git: In gitbash
$ git config --global user.name "sample-username"
$ git config --global user.email sample-emailid

To work on that location:

$ pwd (Shows the current directory and i will be always user's profile ie : c:/users/sample)
$ mkdir git_demo (Folder is created under C:/users/sample/git_demo)
$ cd git_demo/ (this command moves the directory location to git_demo)
$ mkdir FirstRepo (This is a new folder created under git_demo folder)
$ cd FirstRepo/ (Moves the directory inside this)

-----------------Need to initialize this directory to git( It makes it as Master-branch)----------
$ git init (Initilization done it created a hidden file .git in our folder)

$ touch master.txt (Creates a file in that location: FirstRepo)
$ notepad master.txt ( Opens the file for us to edit/view) --> Update some content in it. Till now we are using local host. Git to track we need to add and commit to git.
 Add & Commit changes done in the repository
$ git add . (Adds all the files which has been updated)
$ git commit -m "Message" (Message gets updated)
$ git status ( It gives the info)
$ git log (It gives us the log history)

--------------------------------------------------
Go to github website and sign-up for the first time to connect a local respository/folder to server we need a place holder which is nothing but a repository created in the server as the same name as localrepository)
Note: Dont enable the readme file as the respository is not a new and its an existing one in the localhost)

Step2: Copy https/SSH url to paste it in our gitbash prompt - SSH key is not yet created so used HTTPS URL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/sample-username/Firstrepo.git/ (HTTPS URL copied from the respository)
$ git remote -v (Gives the fetch and push details)
$ git push -u origin master (Pushes the local repository changes to git server with the commit No)

--------Again if you change anything in the local host file need to add,commit and push to git server.......
SSH Mechansium:

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C sample-emailID (It creates a public and private keys)
(It asks for file location to store the key, leave it as default, enter the phrase: "Dont forget this Phrase")
Now go to the public key file ,copy and paste the key into  the github server-->setting-->RSA&GAP keys-->Paste it.
Unique authentication has been created via SSH
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
$ ssh -T git@github.com (Sucessfully logs in to github)
$ ls (list files in that directory)
$ clear (Clear the contents) Shift+ins to paste 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To clone the repsoitory created on server to local host

Go to the github server,create a new repository as SecondRepo, enable readme file as its a new repository getting created directly on the server and copy the SSH URL for the same
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ pwd (Shows the path of current working directory)
$ cd (Leave the directory one level back and its now on /git_demo
$ git clone SSHURL(Copied from git server)
$ ls (will show the SecondRepo folder as well)

$ cd SeondRepo/
$ touch sample3.txt
$ notepad sample3.txt (Write some data, Now we need to add it to git,commit and push it gitserver so that tracking can be enabled for this doc too)
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Created a text file from local and pushing it to the server repository"
$ git push -u origin master
